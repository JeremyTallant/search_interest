# Comparing Search Interest with Google Trends
## Description
Time series data is everywhere; from temperature records, to unemployment rates, to the S&P 500 Index. Another rich source of time series data is Google Trends, where you can freely download the search interest of terms and topics from as far back as 2004. This project dives into manipulating and visualizing Google Trends data to find unique insights.

In this project, we will explore the search data underneath the Kardashian family's fame and make custom plots to find how the most famous Kardashian/Jenner sister has changed over time.
